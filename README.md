# React Todo App

I made this app using:

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/)
- [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/)

Many thanks to [Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC29ju8bIPH5as8OGnQzwJyA) for their React [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBws8MSXN7A).
